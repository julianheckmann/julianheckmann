## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Julian, a dedicated full-stack software engineer who thrives on creating solutions from the initial idea to the finished product. I possess a strong passion for web development and derive satisfaction from working on every aspect of a product.

Presently, I am employed at [Trusted Shops](https://github.com/trustedshops), where my team and I are tasked with managing crucial backbone services. These include a pluggable microfrontend platform, authorization and authentication services, and more.

If you'd like to connect with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/julian-heckmann-b884b7192)!

In my leisure time, I enjoy tinkering with technology, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.
